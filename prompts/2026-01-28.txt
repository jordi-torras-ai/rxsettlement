===============

ok now i need a table "document_types" only visible for admins (so in Admin menu) the table as id and description only.
admins can crud the table. 
below the document types that need to be populated:
```
CENSUS
Summary Benefit Coverage (SBC)
Master Plan Document (MPD) - unless Summary Plan Description (SPD) is used as Master Document
Summary Plan Description (SPD)
Medical/Rx Bundled
Medical (separate admin for Rx)
RX(separate admin for Medical)
```

-------------

for next thing we will use Cloudfare R2. I have a bucket, tell me what you need me to put in .env so you can use it

-----------

cool. now i need a "documents" table. 
it has id, a document type (that links to the documen types we created before), year (int), an intake id, and an id that points to Budget Premium-Equivalent Funding Monthly Rates.
and then a place to drop a document (that goes to r2)
