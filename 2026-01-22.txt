Plan Information 

now i need an "intakes" table
(menu for regular users is "Intake" -no "s" for admin they see "Intakes") 
regular users can see only see their own intakes.
regular users (and admins) can create intakes. 
intakes have 3 field groups:
Primary Day-to-Day for Intake
Contact for Escalations
Other
and each field group has 3 fields:
Name
Title
Email
Phone #	
-----

cool. now i need a table for Vendor Coverages.
users see only their own vendor coverages.
vendor coverages belongs to an intake (and hence a user, of course)
every vendor coverage has these fields:
- Vendor Name
- Vendor Year
- Vendor Contact Name
- Vendor Contact Email
- Fully v. Self-Insured
- Plan Year Start Date
- Plan Year End Date (if applicable)

------

OK. now something sofisticated. 
a new table: plan design year.
plan design is for a year (so year is a field, but it must be 1,2,3 up to 6 in a dropdown)
	it has these fields:
	Employer (Plan Sponsor Name)
	Plan Effective Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
	Current Vendor Name
	Is this a 'new' vendor? (yes/no)
then, under this table, there are several tables, but they will have not independent menu options, instead they need to be inserted/edited/viewed as an inline list so that needs to be sort of master-detail form.

table: Budget Premium-Equivalent Funding Monthly Rates
it has the fields:
	plan name
	Admin Fee Group (string)
	Employee (dollar amount)
	Emp/Spouse (dollar amount)
	Emp/Child (dollar amount)
	Emp/Children	 (dollar amount)
	Family	Plan Term Date (date)

table: Employee Monthly Contributions
it has the fields:
	plan name
	Admin Fee Group (string)
	Employee (dollar amount)
	Emp/Spouse(dollar amount)
	Emp/Child(dollar amount)
	Emp/Children(dollar amount)
	Family(dollar amount)

table: PEPM Admin Fee Group
it has the fields:
	admin fee group (string)
	ASO (dollar amount)
	HSA/HRA Admin (dollar amount)
	Disease Management (dollar amount)
	Tele-health (dollar amount)
	Pharmacy Rebate (Credit) (dollar amount)
	Pharmacy Carveout - PBM Fee (dollar amount)
	Wellness (Fee and/or Credit) (dollar amount)
	Misc. (Broker Fees) (dollar amount)

some rules: an intake cannot have a plan design with same year (so max 6 plan designs for intake)
